## How this script functions
AnimeOcean uses The Movie Database to get selectively Anime movies and TV Show data. It also uses different free video sources to embed videos for the Anime based on the Tmdb ID. It comes with a live search feature that makes use of AJAX to simultaneously search movies and TV shows and then filters them to only render Animations.

The <pre>movie.php</pre> file is responsible for displaying all different movie details based on the submitted movie ID
The <pre>tv.php</pre> file is responsible for displaying all different TV Show details based on the submitted movie ID
The <pre>api.php</pre> file contains the TMDB API class, and you will need to edit it with your own TMDB API.
<pre>movies.php</pre> displays list of recent movies while the <pre>tvshows.php</pre> is for displaying the TV Show list.

Menu, header and footer files are found in the /include folder.
